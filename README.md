 <h1>LibreLoginProd 🔐 - autologin plugin</h1>
  <p>Fork of the <b>LibreLogin</b> (previously LibrePremium) which has caused many problems with newest minecraft versions.

# FAQ

### What does prod mean?
This means that the project is a heavily modified version intended for production use.

### Why is the plugin almost 5MB?
We are currently trying to go down to 500KB, but first we need
to divide whole project into submodules.

### Will the folder name change after installation?
No, we use the same folder and config names as original the **LibreLogin**.
